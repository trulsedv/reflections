When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

When I am coding on several computers, specialy without dropbox sync. Or when I
want other persons to contribute to my codes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I am working on something on one computer then I work on something else on
another and push it to GitHub autopulling it from GitHub to the first computer
could break my work on that computer.
