What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git folder in the directory I specify. This enables Git to track
this directory as a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It include some files in the directory that is not in the repository,
but not all. It enables me to spilt large changes into several commits.
